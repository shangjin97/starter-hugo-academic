abstract: Wearable electronics are increasingly used in health monitoring and treatment in different conditions. However, few devices can adhere conformally to the skin after sports and showers (sweating, deformation, friction). Here, a facile method is presented by providing a metal-polymer conductor (MPC) made with polyethylene glycol (PEG) blended polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based adhesive (PPA) that encapsulates gallium-based liquid metal alloy circuits as epidermal electronics. Adding PEG into PDMS prepolymer can result in a softer and wet-adhesive elastomer that can bear larger deformation than PDMS itself. The soft and adhesive electronics can adhere to the skin conformally for more than 2 d. It has been demonstrated that these electronics can meet the needs of motion detection, electrophysiological signal detection and skin wound healing during a 48 h wearing with sports and shower. It is expected that the wet-adhesive electronic with excellent biosafety can be widely used and solve existing problems in medical adhesives and humanâ€“machine interfaces.
